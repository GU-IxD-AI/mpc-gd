Institute, Falmouth University, released in 2017.

It was one of several "fluidic games" built on Gamika, a parameterized iOS game
engine designed for on-device game creation.

Note as of 2022 (Mark Nelson): This codebase is in Swift 3, which current Xcode
won't touch, either to compile or upgrade. Xcode 10.1 appears to be the last
Xcode that will do a 3->4 conversion.

Note as of 2024 (Swen Gaudl): Codebase runs in XCode 14.2 and Swift 4 but needs testing.
